          Started in 2015, the Magellan project focuses on entity matching, a pervasive problem in
          data integration, which in turn is often required for data science and AI projects.{' '}

          Our goal is to develop software, work with customers, and publish our findings. Notable
          results since the project's inception:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PyMatcher software has been widely used by researchers, domain sciences, and
            companies, and parts of it have been incorporated into several popular open-source
            software.
          </li>
          <li>
            The CloudMatcher software led to the creation of GreenBay Tech and its acquisition by
            Informatica in 2020. CloudMatcher was incorporated into several products of Informatica,
            serving thousands of enterprise customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lessons from PyMatcher and CloudMatcher led to SparkMatcher, which can efficiently match
            hundreds of millions of data tuples, using Spark and AI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Publications from the project have been cited thousands of times, and have received both
            the SIGMOD and CACM Research Highlight Awards.
          </li>
        </ul>

          In 2025 the project has inspired another startup, MadMatcher, founded by Dev Ahluwalia, a
          CS graduate student at UW-Madison. MadMatcher builds on and extends the Magellan software
          with Generative AI capabilities.
