For example, given the two tables A and B shown here, find all tuple\n          pairs (a in A, b in B) that match, such as (Dave Smith, Madison, WI)\n          and (David D. Smith, Madison, WI). We call these pairs “matches\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This problem often arises in data science and AI. Many such projects must combine multiple\n          datasets into a single clean unified dataset, then analyze it to extract\n          insights or use it to train AI. To combine multiple datasets, we often must solve the EM\n          problem.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This problem is challenging for two reasons. First, data instances that match often\n          appear in different forms, using different words, making it difficult to achieve high\n          matching accuracy. Second, Tables A and B are often very large, having 100M to 500M tuples\n          or more, making it difficult to achieve reasonable runtime.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h3>Blocking and Matching</h3>\n        <p>\n          Considering all pairs between Tables A and B is practically infeasible for large\n          tables. So EM is typically performed in two steps: blocking and matching (and the Magellan\n          project develops software for both steps). The blocking step uses heuristics to quickly\n          remove a large number of pairs judged unlikely to match. The matching step applies a rule‑\n          or ML‑based matcher to each remaining pair, to predict match or non‑match.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For example, in the above figure, the blocking step keeps only those pairs that share the\n          same state (this can be done quickly using an index on Column “State”). Then the matching\n          step applies a matcher that predicts pairs (a1,b1) and (a3,b2) to be matches.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h3>Variations of EM and Related Problems</h3>\n        <p>\n          Variations of EM are known as entity resolution, record linkage, deduplication, and more.\n          We use the term “entity matching” because there are many other related problems, and their\n          names all end with “matching.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Specifically, string matching finds strings that refer to the same real-world concept,\n          such as \"UW-Madison\" and \"Univ of Wisc Madison\". Schema matching finds similar columns\n          across tables, such as \"address\" and \"location\". Ontology matching finds similar concepts\n          across ontologies, such as \"car\" and \"automobile\". Other related problems include matching\n          between ontology concepts and table columns, matching tables, and more.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          While Magellan is designed primarily for EM, it can also be used for these related\n          matching problems.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h3>The Magellan Project</h3>\n        <p>\n          This project was started in 2015 at the University of Wisconsin‑Madison. By that time,\n          even though numerous publications on EM existed, we had not found any industrial‑strength\n          EM software. So our goal has been to develop industrial‑strength open‑source software for\n          EM, work with customers to evaluate these products, use the evaluations\n          to refine the products, and publish the findings.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The goal is to release EM software that can find widespread use. Publishing findings is an\n          important part of the project, but is viewed as a side effect of executing the\n          software-customer cycle. We refer to this template as the \"academic startup\" template.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h3>Team and Contact</h3>\n        <p>\n          Over the years many people have contributed to Magellan.
